# WebGL Experiment

This is an experimental 3D implementation built on WebGL. It was primarily built in my personal quest to learn more about WebGL and scene graphs in general.

This project does not build on top of any existing 3D frameworks like Three.js; however, some code has definitely made its way in here. Feel free to do whatever with this repository.

## Getting Started

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
